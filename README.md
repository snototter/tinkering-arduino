# Tinkering with Arduino
Tinkering projects using Arduino. This repository consists of custom libraries and some of my projects.

Overview:
* `libraries/BasicTinkering` - A collection of commonly used Arduino stuff I need for tinkering, e.g. 7-segment displays, (debouncing) buttons, potentiometers, ...
* `projects/SessionChairWatch` - A stop watch for session chairs to time presentations, notify speakers of their last X minutes, go crazy once they exceed their allocated slot.
* `garduino` - TODO (check disk backup for ino files) - watering my tomatoes and chili plants
