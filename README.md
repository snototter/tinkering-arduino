# Tinkering with Arduino
Some of my tinkering projects using Arduino.
Previously, this repository also hosted an Arduino library which is now available at https://github.com/snototter/BasicTinkering.


## Garduino: Automated Plant Watering
* A low-power tinkering project to water my tomatoes and chili plants.
* Only useful to lookup stuff on interrupts, watch dog timers, low-power consumption, setting/using ADC reference voltage, measuring battery levels, etc. This project doesn't build currently (need to find out proper versions -- should be around 2016/2017 -- of external libraries).

## Session Chair's Stop Watch
* A stop watch for session chairs to time presentations.
* Shows the presentation time, notifies speakers of their last X minutes (notification LED) and goes crazy once they exceed their allocated slot.
