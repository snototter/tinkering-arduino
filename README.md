# Tinkering with Arduino
Some of my tinkering projects using Arduino.
Previously, this repository also hosted an Arduino library which is now available at https://github.com/snototter/BasicTinkering.


## Automated Plant Watering
* A low-power tinkering project to water my tomatoes and chili plants.
* Source at `projects/Garduino`.
* Only useful to lookup stuff on interrupts, watch dog timers, low-power consumption, setting/using ADC reference voltage, measuring battery levels, etc. Due to external library updates, this project doesn't build currently.

## Session Chair's Stop Watch
* A stop watch for session chairs to time presentations, notify speakers of their last X minutes and go crazy once they exceed their allocated slot.
* Source at `projects/SessionChairWatch`.
